Ideal Gas Wasp
----
Gray: We've devolved from the Fermi problem of "how many wasps would fit in our office building" to discussing the thermodynamics and phase equilibrium of wasps and chickens.
Kate: I've definitely gone through the "piano tuners in NYC" question with Kyle before, while talking about tech interviewing
Gray: The ones that always come to mind for me, for inexplicable reasons, are "How many polar bears fit inside the sun?" and "How many piano tuners are there in Canada?"
Kate: Polar bears in the sun is a good one. Do we account for the atomization of the bears? Like, do they have to be intact bears, or can the originating incinerated materials just be derived from said bears?
Gray: See, this exact train of reasoning is how the wasp question got so out of hand, because we started trying to figure out the packing efficiency, thermodynamics, and whether you could treat them as an ideal gas (conclusion: probably more ideal than mosquitoes).

Review of the Osaka Aquarium: "It was generally a very good aquarium as well...probably the best one I‚Äôve been to? Just for sheer interesting stuff, plenty of room, and a great deal of charismatic megafauna. The dolphins in particular were pretty incredible to watch."
